            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb facs="tcp:9515:3"/> the ſame. Whatſoeuer I write in this behalfe, I vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it (I humblie thanke God for it) not vaine glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſlie to boaſt, before God or men, in anie thing I haue done, for I know &amp; feele in my ſelfe, that (ouer and beſides my groſſe &amp; greeuous iniquities) euen in the beſt ſeruices that euer I performed in pietie towards God, or in charitie towards his people, there was by reaſon of mine owne corruption, and the imperfections that through the ſame did cleue thervnto, matter ſufficient inough, in truth to abaſe and to humble me indeed: neither yet as cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to craue dailie and new kindneſſes (a vice too common in this corrupt age) the Lord hauing bin pleaſed in that behalfe, to beſtow vpon me more ſimplicitie, than by fawning flatterie to fetch from my freends, anie thing that might ſatisfie large af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, or releeue preſent want.

<pb facs="tcp:9515:3"/> my great greefe and heuineſſe of heart, and ſome incouragement to goodneſſe alſo, when mine owne dulneſſe and backwardneſſe to the ſame, not onelie ariſeth vp in me, but ſtandeth againſt it, as with force and might, to ſtop and hinder me therein. In regard whereof alſo, I doo at this time humblie of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer and preſent vnto you (right honorable &amp; right worſhipfull) togither, firſt a ſound diſcourſe or two, which that learned man M. Beza wrote, and I long ago tranſlated, and withall a ſhort ſumme, that I my ſelfe penned heeretofore, and haue inlarged againe all of them touching that great queſtion of the Lords ſupper. For that woorthie mans woorthie works, I dare proteſt and auer, that if the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, either of the man, or matter, or maner, may purchaſe a frutefull commendation, and procure fauorable acceptation (with them that feare God I meane, &amp; loue his truth ſincerelie) it ſhall not want either the one or the other. For as concerning the writer himſelfe, he is one of the woonders &amp; woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies of the world at this day, a man of rare parts euerie maner of way (whatſoeuer ſome, either of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance in themſelues, or pride of themſelues, barke out againſt him to the contrarie) whether we reſpect ſound knowledge and iudgement, in the toongs and trueth of God, or faithfull paines, and frutefull trauels in his miniſterie and place. And as for the worke, it concerneth a great ground of our chriſtian faith, and the ſame controuerted, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie betweene the ſuperſtitious papiſts and vs, in the queſtion of tranſubſtantiation, but with ſuch alſo as in the common profeſſion of Gods holie word and religion, we charitably take for our brethren, thogh otherwiſe in this point, ouerſhot as we ſay, &amp; ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene alſo. The maner of handling is deepe &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found,
<pb facs="tcp:9515:4"/> and not ſhallow or meane, after the maner and dealing of other men, there being for the more full explication of the queſtion, deducted and laid out, ſundrie of the fundamentall points and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of our chriſtian faith, and namelie touching the ſeuerall and diſtinct natures of God and man, and the perſonall vnion of them in our ſauiour Chriſt. But for mine owne I mind not to ſay much, ſpeciallie as in commendation therof. That which I thinke, I will plainelie expreſſe, and proteſt alſo, namelie that as nothing of mine, is in anie reſpect meet, to behold the light of this learned age, both by reaſon of mine owne wants &amp; inſufficiencie, and alſo by means of the great ripeneſſe of knowledge and iudgement, that God hath ſhed abrode into the hearts of manie men: ſo I confeſſe my ſelfe &amp; my writings, much more vnwoorthie, either the ſame day to be named with that woorthie man of the world, or anie maner of way to be ioined with his. And yet if the church approoue that which I doo, and the godlie receiue ſome profit by it to ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all edification, I ſhall much reioice therin, not as in reſpect of that I haue doone (for I acknowledge my ſelfe to haue nothing ſaue that which I haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) but as in regard of the good effects, that it hath through Gods almightie and ſecret bleſſing, brought foorth in the hearts of them, that haue bin or ſhalbe acquainted therewith: in which treatiſe, I haue ſpeciallie laboured two things. Firſt in the daies of ſo great blindneſſe and ignorance, amongſt the multitude and common ſort of people, as now preuaileth, to inſtruct the ſimple as much as I could in the ſound knowledge of theſe moſt holie myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that ſo neither with the idle and vnskilfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of their owne heads, nor with the ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb facs="tcp:9515:4"/> and erronious opinions of other men concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſame, caſt abrode into the world as baits to catch them, they might be deceiued, and carried away into vntruth, as if it were with a violent tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt &amp; whirlwind. And ſecondlie, that in the midſt of ſo great and generall careleſneſſe, of fitting and preparing men for ſuch woorthie graces, as be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited and offered there (howſoeuer a common corruption that way, hath almoſt carried all away) I might at the leaſt, by reaching them my weake hand and feeble arme, if not altogither pull ſome out of that puddle, and ſo bring them to more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable and ſanctified vſe of theſe pledges of Gods grace, and their faith in the ſame, yet let them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold my loue and ſound affection for the effecting thereof to my vttermoſt. How I haue purſued theſe points, and atteined that I aimed at, let the godlie iudge, to whoſe good cenſures, I doo willinglie ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my ſelfe, &amp; all things that ſhall come from me praieng charitable conſtruction in that I haue doone, and brotherlie admonition if anie thing I haue failed. How it ſhall preuaile, either with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie or anie I know not: the gratious iſſue and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thereof I leaue to the Lord, who if our ſinnes hinder not, ſtanding betweene him &amp; vs, as a huge and high wall, can and will no doubt make it effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall in the minds of manie, to their ſpirituall good. But if your honor (good madame) and you (right worſhipfull and my verie good freends) togither with them that depend vpon you, and belong vnto you, may reape chriſtian inſtruction, and holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thereby, and hauing faith &amp; a good conſcience in all things, may by this and other holie meanes gratiouſlie grow, and mightilie continue, with the increaces of God, euen vnto the fruition of eternall
<pb facs="tcp:9515:5"/> life at the laſt through Chriſt, I ſhall haue that, which I greatlie wiſh &amp; deſire, and ſhall thinke my poore paines well ſatisfied &amp; anſwered, in the good that ſhall light vpon them, whom I doo (as dutie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo requireth) vnfeinedlie both reuerence and loue in Ieſus Chriſt. Thus humblie praieng pardon of my boldneſſe for this dedication, and earneſtlie crauing acceptation of my ſimple trauels, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that accuſtomed courteſie that you are woont to ſhew to them, that come to ſhroud themſelues vnder you, I doo in the moſt dutifull maner that I may or can for this preſent time end. <hi>At London the ſixt of this Februarie:</hi> 1587.</p>

               </gap> began to be vſed.</p>
            <p>Now let vs ſpeake more plainlie what we call perſon, or meane by that name, when we intreat of Chriſt, whether that, which is as it were compounded, of the Godhead taking, and of the fleſh taken, ſo that, if it might be lawfull for vs to diuide Chriſt into his parts, one part of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould be his Godhead, and the other part his manhood?<note place="margin">Chriſtes man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood cannot properlie be called a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the cauſe therof.</note> Not ſo at anie hand, for Chriſt is not ſaid or called a perſon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlie in reſpect of his humanitie or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, but of his diuine nature onelie, and yet that not to be ſeparated from his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. This is the cauſe or reaſon thereof: If Chriſtes humane nature had beene, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was taken of the diuine nature: that is to ſay, of the word, there ſhould then be an vnton of two perſons, and not of two natures, and therfore Chriſt ſhould be a perſon compact of two perſons, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:9515:9"/> would inſue manie abſurd, vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, yea altogither wicked &amp; vngodlie matters, whereof nowe there is neyther time nor place to ſpeake. Therefore thus it muſt be determined, that the diuine nature tooke on it the humane nature, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and faſhioning it: and euen whiles it was formed and faſhioned, to haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it vnto it ſelfe, that is to ſaie, that Chriſtes humane nature was neuer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, or had beeing, but in the Godhead: wherfore the humane nature in Chriſt,<note place="margin">Chriſt as hee is God, is a perſon, &amp; his godhead is a nature, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo his manhood.</note> is not a perſon, but the humanitie ſubſiſteth, and hath his being in this perſon of the word, and therfore Chriſt is not either in imagination or in deede, a double perſon, but one perſon conſiſting of two natures. For the word is both a nature &amp; a perſon, but the manhood is not of it ſelfe, anie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing than a nature, which (as they ſpeake in the ſcholes) is become a perſon,<note place="margin">There is but one ſonne of God, as there is but one Chriſt.</note> and is vpholden in the godhead taking it vnto it ſelfe, ſo that now there are not two ſonnes, to wit, one eternall and naturall, or of the ſubſtance and being of the father, and another created and adopted, but that onelie eternall ſonne of GOD, ſuſtaining and vpholding the nature vnited to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:9515:10"/> ſo that alſo there are not two Chriſts, but one onelie, God and man together, from the time that he knitte or vnited to himſelfe the nature which he tooke. Now we learne what we may call the perſon of Chriſt,<note place="margin">What the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt is.</note> to wit, the ſon of God manifeſted in the fleſh.</p>
            <p>Let vs come nowe to the word vnion: for vniting is that whereby theſe two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to wit, the godhead or the perſon of the word, and the humanitie or manhood are coupled together. The Grecians call this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,<note place="margin">What vnion or vniting is.</note> that is, the coupling or ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning together of two thinges or more, in ſuch ſort, that of thoſe many things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng together, ſome one certaine thing is compounded or made.<note place="margin">There are diuers ſorts of vniting.</note> And there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers kinds of vnitings: for ſometimes na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> is vnited with the forme or ſhape: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſometime an accident with the ſubiect: &amp; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſometime parts are vnited and knit vnto parts, to eſtabliſh or make a whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.<note place="margin">Vniting, and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, or vnitie differ much.</note> Wherefore vniting is one thing, and vnitie or oneneſſe (as a man might ſaye) is an other thing. For one or oneneſſe is not a number, neither dooth it neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſuppoſe a number<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Theſe words are diligently to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, &amp; ſo much the more, bicauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> neglect thereof bringeth forth great confuſions &amp; troubles in theſe diſputations &amp; matters. Certainely, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, that is, vnitie, or oneneſſe, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither diuers matters. For in the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of the Trinitie, there is vnitie or oneneſſe of the eſſence, and a Trinitie in the perſons. Againe, on the other ſide, there is in Chriſt an vniting of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and an vnitie or oneneſſe of the perſon. Wherefore the Fathers ſaide well, that in the diuinitie, there is not an other thing, and an other thing, that is to ſay,<note place="margin">In the godhead there is but one ſimple being.</note> two thinges (for in the diuinitie there is but one onely and moſt ſimple eſſence or being) but an other and an other meaning perſons. For the Father is one, an other is the Son, and the Holie-ghoſt is an other. The reaſon is, becauſe when we ſay another, we mean the perſon: when wee ſaye an other thing, wee meane the nature. Wherefore there is not an other
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:9515:11"/> thing in the diuinity, for ſo there ſhould be multiplication or multitude of Gods. In Chriſt on the other ſide, there is an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing,<note place="margin">In Chriſt there is two natures, but not two perſons.</note> and an other thing (becauſe the godhead is an other thing than the manhood) and not an other, and an other, bicauſe Chriſt is but one ſubſiſtence or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, conſiſting not of two perſons, but of mans nature being taken, which hath his ſubſiſting and being in the diuine nature.</p>
            <p>Let vs nowe come to a more full and large declaration of the word vnion, or v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting. This kinde and maner of vnion or vniting,<note place="margin">Errors cannot be wel confu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

I repeate this againe: The hypoſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call or perſonall vnion is that, from which reboundeth or proceedeth our hypoſtaſies or perſon: for the more plaine manifeſting and declaring whereof the fathers haue vſed the ſimilitude of the bodie and the

Verily in the reſurrection, the ſoule is not taken vp againe, but the bodie: therefore theſe words cannot be aſcribed to Chriſt, either in reſpect of his bodie onelie, or in reſpect of his ſoule onely:<note place="margin">or of them both togither,</note> What then is it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of them both together? No, rather neceſſarie is it that wee referre it to ſome third thing, which may be ſaide to laie downe, and to take vp his ſoule. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt ſo ſpake according to his dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: and when hee ſaieth,<note place="margin">but of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</note> that he hath po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to laie downe his life, and to take it againe, he dooth againe open that myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie or ſecret which wee handle. For the verie natures indeede ſo ioyned together, are in ſuche ſorte ſette out, that not two things, but one alone is eſtabliſhed, and that without confuſion, yet ſo that the one nature beareth rule. And it is meete to be marked that Chriſt ſaieth: I haue power to laie downe, not euery ſoule, but mine owne. Wherefore this cannot ſo be
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:9515:15"/> taken, nor referred to this end, that God ſhould be the lord of all being things, but he ſheweth, that that ſoule of his which he would lay down &amp; take again, was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe his ſoule, than other mens ſoules are theirs. How then is it Chriſtes ſoule will ſome men ſay? Verily by perſonall vnion. The ſcripture ſaith that God dwelleth in vs,<note place="margin">Iohn. 4.12.</note> and yet we beleeue and confes, that he dwelleth not in his ſaints, by his vnion or vniting:<note place="margin">1.

               <hi>For our bodies are ſo the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples of the holy ghoſt,</hi> that yet they make not one ſubſiſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or being with the holy ghoſt ſith that the ſanctified party is ſeuerally &amp; by himſelfe a certaine thing, &amp; ſo likewiſe the holy ghoſt, to wit, god eternall. So a wicked ſpirit, and ſome one poſſeſſed with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame wicked ſpirit, are ioined togither, &amp; yet the vncleane ſpirite is not in man, as the ſoule is in the bodie. For the wicked ſpirit remaineth by it ſelf, a certain thing much like as the gheſt is in his inne: and againe, the poſſeſſed with the wicked ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is ſo become the inne or lodging place of the wicked ſpirite, that yet the gheſt is another from him. As for vs we affirme, the perſon of the word, or ſon of God ſo to dwell in that manhood that he hath taken
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:9515:15"/> vnto him, that hee hath vnited himſelfe thereto by a perſonall vnion: ſo I ſay, that the nature taken or aſſumed, being ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and vpheld in the nature taking or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming, maketh yet notwithſtanding but one perſon, which is the eternall worde of God. Hereupon it foloweth that there are not two ſonnes of God, much leſſe two Chriſts, one, the ſon of Marie, the other, the ſon of God,<note place="margin">Matth. 1.21.23</note> but one <hi>Immanuel</hi> and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uior onelie. And this is the very true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the perſonall vnion, as wil yet much more plainelie appeare, if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with this truth touching the perſonal vnion:<note place="margin">Sundrie ſorts of errors.</note> the deſcriptions that are partlie felt from the olde hereſies, and partlie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new deuiſed by the freſh furbuſhing of the aforeſaid hereſies. Firſt, there are ſome that feare not openly to ſay, that the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or dwelling of God in Chriſt, is not otherwiſe to be conſidered in Chriſt, or that he doth no otherwiſe dwell in him, than in other men, yea than in other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.<note place="margin">Iacobus Andre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as aſſertion, and the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed.</note>

If a man demaund what ſhall be the difference of the perſonall vnion: this ſhall be their anſweare, that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth herein, that into all other things the godhead hath powred forth ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties or qualities, but into Chriſtes hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity or manhoode hee hath powred all properties. A wonderfull thing, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that theſe opinions haue nowe a long while ſince bin toſſed, and by the ſolemne and moſt iuſt iudgements of Chriſtes church, condemned and confounded by ſo many darts, as haue come from heauen it ſelfe, againſt the authors and fautors of theſe vngodlie blaſphemies, a maruellous thing, I ſay, that there ſhould now ſpring vp ſome, as dare be bolde, both by worde and writing, to maintaine and defend the ſame, and that with ſo great reioicing and commendation of moſt vnſkilfull men: for who is he vnles hee be altogither blinde, that ſeeth not, that if the word be no other wiſe preſent in chriſt, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in many things, (that is to ſay, beingly, preſently, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

And that if wee grant an effuſion or powring forth of all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties of the godhead into the fleſh aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med or taken, that then the other part of the vngodlie aſſertion of <hi>Eutyches,</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His is the ſum of the thinges that wee ſpake in the former Sermon, to wit,<note place="margin">The ſumme of the former Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, conſiſting of foure parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular points.</note> that 1 al the knowledge of our ſaluation, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> did depend of the knowlege of Chriſt: and that wee 2 had in Chriſt, principally two <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> things to be conſidered, that is to ſaye, ſuch as did concerne the knowledge of his perſon, and ſuch alſo as did concerne the knowledge of his offices. We haue heard, 3 that vnder the name or worde of perſon, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> there was meant Chriſt himſelfe: further, that that perſon conſiſted of two natures, that is, the godhead &amp; the manhoode, both of theſe being ſo vnited and ioyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the very natures themſelues, &amp; their properties alſo remaining ſound and vnconfounded, Chriſt by that meanes is become, but one ſubſiſtence or being. For wee haue alreadie affirmed, the godhead ſo to haue aſſumed and taken the manhood vnto it, that they are not now two perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but two natures: of which two natures, the one, that is to ſay, the nature aſſumed
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:9515:26"/> or taken, is ſuſtained and vpheld, or (as I may ſo ſay) made a perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with the nature aſſuming, that is to ſay, the godhead: from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4 this wee proceeded, to ſpeake of ſuche things, as were attributed to, or ſpoken of either of the natures, or the whole perſon: and wee affirmed, that they were ſo to be vſed, as that we alwaies preſerued the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the perſon, and continuallie auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the confounding of the natures. For ſeeing theſe two natures,<note place="margin">Synodus Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonenſis.</note> are as the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node of Chalcedon ſaieth, vndiuidedlie, vnſeparablie, and vnconfoundedlie coup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led together in the perſonall vnion: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie is it, that either of theſe natures, ſhould haue their owne proper thinges at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed vnto them, and therfore, not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated vnto others. Wherfore ſome things attributed to the godhead, and ſom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>things alſo attributed vnto the manhood, were ſo proper and peculiar to the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and the manhoode, that thoſe that were attributed to the one, coulde not be ſpoken of the other without great impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and vngodlineſſe. Notwithſtanding, by reaſon of the perſonal vnion (excepting alwaies that which is attributed to the whole perſon, and belongeth to both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:9515:26"/> as when Chriſt is called the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and ſuch like) ſuch things as are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the godhead, and therefore as wee haue ſaid can neuer be ſpoken of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode) are yet notwithſtanding attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Chriſt as man: and againe, ſuche things as are proper to man, are ſpoken, and that rightlie of God, but neuer, or at no hand of the godhead. The reaſon is, becauſe that the ſubſiſtence or being is denominated euen in the concret of one of the natures onelie. So by the Sonne of GOD, wee doo many times vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,<note place="margin">1. Timoth. 3.16.</note> not onely the godhead of the ſonne by it ſelfe, but Chriſt manifeſted in the fleſhe. And by the GOD of glorie wee meane GOD become or made man: and like wiſe by ſonne of man, we meane man aſſumed or taken of the eternall ſon of God.</p>
            <p>Whereby it commeth to paſſe, that by reaſon of that perſonall vnion, ſome thinges in the concret, may bee ſaide of the whole perſon, which yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in the abſtracte,<note place="margin">1. Corinth. 2.8.</note> doo agree to one of the natures onelie. So Saint Paule affyrmeth, that the GOD of glorie was crucified, which propoſition
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:9515:27"/> is not true touching whole Chriſt,<note place="margin">One and the ſelfe-ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition true and vntrue in ſeuerall ſenſes.</note> that is to ſay, if wee regarde or conſider Chriſt, as ſome whole matter, conſiſting of ſome particulars: but not true, if wee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it of all or euery thing belonging to Chriſt, that is to ſaye, if wee ſeuerally and diſtinctlye conſider his ſeuerall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, becauſe the name of the GOD of glorie, dooth in the abſtract agree or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, to the onelie godhead. Wherefore this propoſition is true in the ſenſe as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whereas otherwiſe it is a wicked and an vngodlie thing to ſay, that the godhead was crucified. Likewiſe in the creede of the Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Symbol. Apoſt.</note> we ſay, that wee beleeue in Ieſus Chriſt the onely Sonne of God, conceiued, borne, ſuffered, &amp;c: all which are truely and chriſtianly ſpoken. And why ſo? Becauſe that by the name of the Sonne of God in the councell, we meane not God, the word, by himſelfe alone, but GOD manifeſted in the fleſh. So the Sonne of man talking with Nicodemus on earth was in heauen:<note place="margin">Iohn. 3.13.</note> the reaſon is, becauſe he that is man, is God alſo: and yet the manhoode of chriſt was at that time no where elſe,<note place="margin">Actes 1.11.</note> but on earth, euen as nowe alſo chriſts fleſh being taken vp into<note place="margin">Matth. 28.20.</note>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:9515:27"/> heauen, and therefore abſent from vs, that Sonne of man, is yet notwithſtanding preſent with vs, becauſe the ſame chriſt is that true GOD,<note place="margin">Iſaiah 66.1. Actes 7.48.</note> whome neither hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen nor earth can containe. Wherefore, as theſe propoſitions are falſe, the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head is the manhoode, or the manhoode is the godhead: ſo theſe are true: This man is God, and GOD, the worde, is man. Nowe then, if man be truely ſaide to be God, by reaſon of the perſonall vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it followeth therevppon, that thinges attributed to the manhoode may rightlie be attributed to GOD: and on the other ſide, that things attributed to the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head may rightly be attributed to, or ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of chriſt, man. But let vs now come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other part of the knowledge that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth our ſaluation, that is, to chriſtes office. This office is declared in his name:<note place="margin">Matth. 1.21.</note> for he is Ieſus, that is to ſay, a Sauiour, becauſe God the father hath therefore gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him vnto vs, that hee might ſaue vs, to wit, from our ſinnes. Now hee ſaueth vs, by iuſtifieng vs, becauſe eternall life, doth of neceſſitie agree with iuſtice or righteouſnes. Wherefore hee giueth vs life, in giuing vs righteouſneſſe, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:9515:28"/> that of his meere and onely grace, through the power and effectuall working of his holie ſpirit:<note place="margin">One and the ſelfe-ſame pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in mans creation and mans reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſauing that this latter, in my iudgement, and before men (though not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God) ſeeme to be the more excellent and hard worke.</note> for euen that very ſelfe-ſame power of God, which laide it ſelfe open in the creation of man, muſt of neceſſity ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt it ſelfe alſo in reſtoring of man.</p>
            <p>This is it that I meane: as God the father did freelie through his ſonne, togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his almightie power, which is the holie-ghoſt, create man: ſo the ſelfe-ſame god, dooth by ſauing iuſtifie, and by iuſtifieng ſaue man, through his owne ſin fallen from grace, and yet made againe, or anewe, as it were, through his ſonne, in the powerfull working of the holie ſpirit. For the holy-ghoſt worketh in vs that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument which we cal faith, by which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we lay hold of chriſt after that we know him. Neither is this faith ſome ſimple or bare accident, but a habit, as they call it in the ſchooles, truelie grafted in vs, not by nature, but by gods meere and free grace. But remember, I pray you, that by laying holde of Chriſt, I vnderſtand the apprehenſion or taking holde euen of Chriſt himſelfe.<note place="margin">Two things principallie to be conſidered in Chriſt.</note> For wee muſt conſider two things in Chriſt, that is to ſaie, hee himſelfe, god and man, and ſuch things
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:9515:28"/> as bee in him.<note place="margin">A fit ſimilitude.</note> For example (though it may be I confes, that the ſimilitude ſhall not agree in all points) if in a caſket or boxe I ſet before a man, treaſure, he that will haue the treaſure hidden or ſhutte vp therein, muſt of neceſſitie take the caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket or boxe it ſelfe:<note place="margin">Coloſſ. 2.3.</note> euen ſo there are in Chriſt, all thoſe treaſures of wiſedome and vnderſtanding: yea (and to ſpeake all in fewe wordes) all thoſe things, which are neceſſarily required to our ſaluation. Wherefore wee muſt of neceſſitie haue him, that ſo we may obtaine thoſe things that are in him, and by the meanes of them eternall life. But tell vs, by what inſtrument wee doo take holde of him, as it were, by a certaine hand, that hee may wholie become ours, and wee his? Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilie by faith. Nowe the holie-ghoſt is hee, who going about to woorke in vs, this excellent inſtrument of faith, vſeth for that purpoſe, the preachyng of the outwarde worde,<note place="margin">Roman. 10.17.</note> by which worde hee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone properlye woorketh inuiſiblye in vs.</p>
            <p>But that we may the better vnderſtand this point, lette vs a little compare this naturall inſtrument of Faith, to witte,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:9515:29"/> the outward worde with that ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall inſtrument, that is, the ſpirite.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Light of nature may ſomewhat helpe vs to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine naturall things, but it can nothing further vs in the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and beleeuing of heuenly things.</note>The doctor or teacher by ſpeaking, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth his ſcholers that which he ſpeaketh. For ſpeech is the inſtrument and meane, whereby we lay open the meaning of our mindes one of vs to an other, by vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding whereof, they to whome wee ſpeake, become ſkilfull in thoſe thinges that wee ſpeake: euen ſo it pleaſeth God to vſe his word written and preached, that ſo hee might teach vs the knowledge of ſaluation, yet the way and order in both of theſe is maruellouſly diuers, if not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether contrary. For whereas our minde by a certaine ingendred and natural pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, is apt to conceiue &amp; vnderſtand world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie things (yea, and though it be true, that ſome men are more apte to learne than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſome, yet all men generallie, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with facultie and power, to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand thoſe points, either by bookes, or the mouth of their teacher) when wee come to the true knowledge of God, and that his heuenlie ſecret touching our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, God muſt of neceſſitie vſe a far other po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, in framing and diſpoſing our minds, that ſo our eares beeing purged, and our
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:9515:29"/> harts alſo, we may in our vnderſtanding comprehend theſe matters, and hauing comprehended them approoue of them, yea conſent vnto them, and ſtay our ſelues vpon them, or elſe we ſhall neuer attaine thereto. And this is that ſame inuiſible working power of the holie-ghoſt, which graueth into our heartes that which the minde perceiueth or vnderſtandeth: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the paſtors and techers might ſpeak to deafe people, as it doth by too too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon examples appeare at this day. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle ſaieth,<note place="margin">1. Corinth. 1.23.</note> that the goſpell is an offenſe or ſtumbling blocke to the Iewes, and that it ſeemeth fooliſhneſſe vnto the Gentiles. And in another place, that it is to ſome,<note place="margin">2. Corinth. 2.16.</note> the ſauor of life vnto life, and to other-ſome, the ſauor of death vnto death. But to whome is it the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor of life vnto life? Euen vnto ſuche as ſo perceiue and receiue it, that they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and ſubmit themſelues thereto. And yet it can not be vnderſtood and receiued, vnleſſe the holie-ghoſt doo by his power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full grace alter and change vs. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to them then it muſt bee the ſauor of death vnto death that doo refuſe it, and caſt it farre from them. Neither is God,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:9515:30"/> or the goſpell it ſelfe, cauſe of this neglect or contempt, but the verye corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man:<note place="margin">1. Corinth. 2.14.</note> for the naturall manne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth not the thinges of the ſpirite of God.</p>
            <p>But to come to the matter: that word of GOD that ſoundeth into our eares, is an inſtrument ordained and directed by the Holie-ghoſt to teach vs, that ſo wee maye vnderſtande ſuche thinges as are needefull to bee vnderſtoode for ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and may by true faith applie vnto our ſelues ſuche thinges as wee vnderſtoode, and haue yeelded vnto.<note place="margin">The word by it ſelfe.</note> And this ſpeeche of GOD talking ſo with vs, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times naked, as it were, and ſimple, and ſometimes againe, is ſo decked and trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as it were, with other things, that euen the matter it ſelfe, by reaſon of the rites and orders,<note place="margin">The worde with the ſacraments annexed therto.</note> annected to the ſpeech, ſeemeth after a ſort, not to be ſpoken, but to be doone. Examples of the naked or bare ſpeech, are theſe infinite promiſes of the goſpell: as when wee heare this, <hi>GOD ſo loued the worlde that hee gaue his onelie begotten Sonne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn. 3.16.</note> 
               <hi>that whoſoeuer beleeueth in him ſhoulde not periſhe, but haue eternall life.</hi> So
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:9515:30"/> we reade, and daily heare in the church, the writings of the Prophets &amp; Apoſtles, hauing exhortations, reprehenſions, and comforts adioyned to the ſame, according as good ſheepheards, do their duetie, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely and priuately. And yet there are ſometimes ioyned to this word of GOD ſome ſignes, with certaine rites and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that ſo the ſpeeche may not onelie beate orders, but alſo the thinges that are looked vppon may come to our ſight. And theſe are thoſe thinges that the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine writers call ſacraments:<note place="margin">Auguſt. cont. Fauſt. Memictiae lib. 19 cap. 16. &amp; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit. tom. 6. col. 349.</note> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Auguſtine alſo called them viſible words.</p>
            <p>This verilye is certaine, that euen the moſt auntient Latine diuines did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprete that Greeke worde, Myſterie, by the Latine word Sacrament, and that not onelie in places where mention is made, of the rites and orders of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the church, as of Baptiſme and the Lords ſupper, but generally wher the queſtion is of ſuche thinges as are of themſelues cloſe &amp; ſecret, and far remoued from common vſe.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 1.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> So the calling of the Gentiles which the Apoſtle nameth a myſterie, is of the olde Latine interpreter
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:9515:31"/> turned,<note place="margin">1. Timoth. 3.16.</note> ſacrament. And our whole ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is the ſacrament of godlineſſe with him: and the coniunction of Chriſt, &amp; his church, &amp; not the marriage of man &amp; wife, as commonlie thorough ignorance menne haue ſuppoſed, is with him a ſacrament likewiſe,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.32. Apocal. 17.7.</note> yea &amp; in the reuelation he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth the ſacrament of that vncleane harlot, and the beaſt that carried hir.</p>
            <p>To be ſhort, nothing is more common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt the Latine diuines, or commeth more often in their writings, than this worde, ſacrament. And yet the Latine church hath in a more ſecret and narrowe ſignification taken and vnderſtoode this terme,<note place="margin">Sacrament, how it is vſed amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt vs.</note> ſacrament, namelie, for the ſignes and rites, which God hath adioyned to his promiſes, that ſo hee might the more fully ſeale vp in our hearts, the ſaluation that he hath reuealed vnto vs. And yet no other certainetie, ſo farre as I knowe, or can remember is this worde, myſterie, in the Apoſtles writings, vſed in that ſenſe or ſignification.</p>
            <p>Verilie, the name or word, ſacrament, it ſelfe is amongeſt the Latiniſts of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſignifications: for which doubtfulneſſe of the worde, we that nowe come in the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:9515:31"/> laſt age of the worlde doo ſuſtaine manye and great ſmartes. The Apoſtle calleth circumciſion, a ſigne and a ſtate:<note place="margin">Roman. 4 11.</note> and (to ſpeake plainely, as the matter it ſelfe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth) though I doo not willinglie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from wordes in vſe, leaſt one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience and miſchiefe might be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped vppon an other, yet I hadde leiffer that the Latin authours and writers, had ſtill kept Paules worde.</p>
            <p>But that we may at the length come to the purpoſe,<note place="margin">What the lords ſupper is.</note> let that rite or order of the Lordes ſupper bee a ſigne giuen vs from GOD, whereby hee will haue teſtified and ſealed vp vnto vs, the communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or partaking of the bodie and bloud of Chriſt. But becauſe euery thing that is vſed, in, and about this holie banquet, is not of one ſort, maner, order, and reſpect, we are therefore to marke, that euen this worde, ſacrament,<note place="margin">The word Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, in the narrow ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation taken three waies.</note> and that in this more narrowe ſignification, is of the olde La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine diuines taken three manner of ways. For ſometimes they vnderſtand by ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the verie whole action, in which reſpect both baptiſme and the Lords ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per it ſelfe alſo, are called ſacraments, that is to ſay, myſtical actions or outward
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:9515:32"/> rites, which doo repreſent to our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſome other certaine thing. Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times againe not the whole action it ſelfe, but that which is vſed in that action, is ſo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> termed, as in baptiſme the water it ſelfe, &amp; the ſprinckling or laying it on the party baptized: and in the Lords ſupper, bread &amp; wine, with the rites and orders that chriſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> himſelfe ordained. And this againe, by a double manner of ſpeech, for ſometimes vnder this worde, there are meant onely the outward ſignes, as when Auguſtine affirmeth,<note place="margin">Auguſt.</note> that the wicked do eate Chriſt, as in reſpect of the ſacrament. And ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is vſed for the ſignes, ioyned with the very thing it ſelfe ſignified, as when <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Irenaeus.</note> that the ſacrament conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth of two things, one heauenlie, and the other earthlie: for hee calleth the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie thing the body and bloud of chriſt, and the earthlie, the bread and the wine: and all that together hee nameth, the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. And this much concerning the word it ſelfe, or the name ſacrament. Let vs now at the length come to the matter.</p>
            <p>Sith nowe therefore, that euerie ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is a ſigne, wee muſt needes put the word Sacrament in the predicament
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:9515:32"/> of relation or relatiues, as the logicians call them, that is, amongſt ſuch things as haue mutuall reſpectes one of them to an other. And ſith relation muſt needes be, amongeſt ſundrie thinges which haue mutuall reſpect one of them to an other, wee muſt therefore of neceſſitie confeſſe, that in the ſacraments there is a ſigne, and the thing ſignified. Neyther when I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer theſe <hi>2</hi> parts, which indeed do meete, or wherof in truth al ſacraments do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, do I ſhut out the word.<note place="margin">Auguſt.</note> Let the worde (ſaith Auguſtine) come vnto the element, and it ſhal become a ſacrament. I do not therefore exclude or ſhut out the worde, which is, as it were, the life &amp; ſoule of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the parts, and to which the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments themſelues, as wee haue ſaide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, are adioyned as ſeales. And thus farre foorth, euen they agree with vs, which otherwiſe doo moſt of all diſſent from vs. Wherefore lette vs nowe ſee, which bee thoſe ſignes, and which bee thoſe thinges ſignified: for in this point we doo not all agree. Wee call water the ſigne in Baptiſme, and the thing ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed we call Chriſts bloud, by the waſhing whereof (we hauing obtained forgiuenes
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:9515:33"/> of ſinnes, and being mortified in our fleſh) we are ſaued.</p>
            <p>But concerning baptiſme I will not nowe ſay anie more. In the ſupper cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainelie there are two ſignes, or rather, ſignes of two ſortes. For ſome of them are certaine materiall and ſubſtantiall ſignes: as for example, the bread and wine, other-ſome are actions and ſacramentall rites, which are not for all that vaine or ſuperfluous acts, but haue there certaine ſacramentall conſideratton and reſpect, from the Lordes inſtitution, of whiche point wee will ſpeake heereafter. I ſay then that in the Lordes ſupper, theſe are outward, materiall, viſible, and as you would ſay palpable ſignes, that God hath annected vnto his word, euen the bread and wine.</p>
            <p>This the Papiſtes denie, as who (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that they haue confeſſed, that the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments doo conſiſt, of a ſigne, and a thing ſignified) doo yet notwithſtanding afterwardes take the bare accidents of bread and wine, as, coulour, forme, and ſuch like, for the ſignes themſelues: for they maintaine, that in the Lords ſupper there remaineth not, the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of bread
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:9515:33"/> and wine, but that that vaniſheth away, &amp; that there co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth in the place thereof, the ſubſtance of the Lords bodie and bloud. Therefore in their iudgement, the ſignes ſhall be the accidents. And which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you? Forſooth whiteneſſe, roundnes, and redneſſe, if they conſecrate red wine, which accidents they doo by a new name call kind, ſhew, or forme.<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> But as Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine rightlie teacheth: Vnleſſe there were a certeine analogie, proportion, and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment betweene the things ſignified, &amp; the ſignes themſelues, they could not be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſacraments. Now betweene accidents &amp; ſubſtances there is no agreement, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſacraments, as they call them, ſhal not be ſacraments: for it behooueth the ſignes ſo to agree with the things ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they may repreſent to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s minds that which they ſignifie.

Now I come to the third point of this diſcourſe: for firſt I haue ſpoken of the ſignes, and ſecondlie of the things ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.<note place="margin">Two ſorts of people that in the ſacrament of the ſupper haue erred in and about the right coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the ſignes, and the thing ſignified.</note> Now we are to ſee in the third place, what is the knitting or ioining togither of the ſignes, and the thinges ſignified, wherein for the moſt part conſiſteth the whole determination of all this controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie touching the ſacraments. The papiſts haue altered the ioining togither of the ſignes, and the thing ſignified, into a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation or change one of them into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: than which, what can be more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd?
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:9515:37"/> For certeinlie, if the bread and the wine be in deede changed into the bodie and bloud of Chriſt, as they affirme, then we cannot chuſe but affirme alſo, that this is not to ioine the ſignes with the thinges ſignified, but to change the ſignes into the thinges themſelues, or elſe the ſignes vaniſhing away or periſhing, to put the thinges themſelues in their roome. But let theſe men go, as who in deed deſerue not anie confutation, their aſſertions be ſo abſurd and blockiſh. There are others, at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> this preſent no leſſe hard &amp; ſharpe againſt vs, than the verie papiſtes themſelues, who will haue the thing ſignified, that is to ſay, the verie bodie of Chriſt ſo to be ioined with or vnder, or in the bread, that in that verie place where that bread is, there muſt alſo be the bodie of Chriſt: which in like ſort is to be vnderſtood al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, touching the wine and the bloud of Chriſt. If a man then ſhould demand, where is the verie bodie &amp; bloud of Chriſt in the action of the ſupper:<note place="margin">A groſſe abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie or two fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation.</note> if wee will anſwere according to their opinion, we muſt ſay, that it is truelie and in deed in our hands, and in our mouth, and therfore certeinelie, vnleſſe it preſentlie vaniſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:9515:38"/> within this bodie of ours, with, in, or vnder the verie ſignes of the bread &amp; the wine, being eaten and drunken. Now we will ſhew, and that by reaſons not fet from humane philoſophie (as our aduerſaries vntrulie ſay we vſe ſuch) but from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie word of God it ſelfe,<note place="margin">Two things to be handled: viz. the confutation of the aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, &amp; the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the truth.</note> that this conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation (as we may trulie call it) is no leſſe abſurd and erronious than tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, as alſo that that communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or partaking, which out of the pure word of God we propound and teach in our churches, is a moſt ſecret and diuine matter. Wherefore our iudgement is quite &amp; cleane contrarie to either of thoſe opinions before rehearſed. To begin, we hold that ſuch things as are ſpoken of the ſacraments, muſt be vnderſtood ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentallie. For what I pray you is or can be more vpright than to haue all thinges ſpoken, rightlie vnderſtood and perceiued, as the nature of that matter will beare, whereof there is queſtion?<note place="margin">A ſimilitude or two, explaning the point he hath in hand.</note> Certeinelie ſuch thinges as the lawiers ſpeake tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the law, muſt be vnderſtood euen as they are vſed in that verie ſcience of the law: and we muſt needs giue the ſelfe ſame iudgement of all things and arts
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:9515:38"/> whatſoeuer. Such thinges therefore, as are taught and deliuered touching the ſacraments, muſt be ſacramentallie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. What manner of coniunction then is the coniunction or knitting togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ſigne and the thing ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallie ſignified? Verilie it is ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall. The ſignes therfore, and the things are ioined togither by that relation or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, which is betweene the ſignes and the thinges ſignified: which yet once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, I doo moſt plainelie declare after this maner.</p>
            <p>When we heare ſome man ſpeaking vnto vs in the toong we vnderſtand, the words that come to our eares and ſtrike them, doo verie liuelie repreſent that vnto our mindes for the expreſſing and ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation whereof they were vſed.<note place="margin">Another ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude.</note> For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: as ſoone as we heare the word Rome, preſentlie wee thinke vpon that citie. If a man name Ceſar or the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, Ceſar or the emperour preſenlie commeth to our memorie. The reaſon whereof verilie is that, that is well deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered and taught in ſchooles: to wit, ſuch thinges as are in the voice or words are ſignes of the affections, that are
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:9515:39"/> in the ſoule or minde. There is the ſelfe ſame conſideration to be had of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: for the ſacraments are nothing elſe, but viſible words, that is, repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, through our eies vnto our mindes, things ſignified, as words heard, doo by our eares conuey vnderſtanding to our minds likewiſe. Therfore theſe viſible ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of bread &amp; wine bring to paſſe, that when I ſee and receiue that bread, and that wine ioined with the word of God, I doo withall conceiue in my mind, and vnderſtand, that bodie that was giuen for me, and that bloud that was ſhed for me, as though I were led or carried euen vnto the thing it ſelfe being preſent. And becauſe I am commanded not onelie to looke vpon theſe ſignes with mine eies, but alſo to take them,<note place="margin">Math. 26.26.27.</note> eat them, drinke them, therefore dooth the faithfull minde euen lay hold of, and applie vnto himſelfe thoſe things ſo ſignefied, as they are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered and offered. Touching which point we will largelie diſcourſe in the fourth place, to wit, when we ſhall come to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle this queſtion, how both the ſignes and the thinges ſignified are receiued of vs: whereas now we onelie diſpute or ſpeake
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:9515:39"/> touching the ſacramentall coniunction of the ſignes themſelues,<note place="margin">Two errours mainteined by the aduerſaries.</note> with the thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified. Such as are not content with this ſacramentall coniunction, fall into a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble errour, not onelie that they doo in a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> a great and groſſe errour verilie eſtabliſh a real vnion of the ſignes with the things ſignified, of which we haue ſpoken before: but alſo they further adde this, that euen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in that verie place whereſoeuer the ſignes are offered to ſuch as come to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, there is preſent the fleſh and the bloud of Chriſt, that is to ſay, they would haue vs confeſſe that euen his verie hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie or manhood is in deed preſent there, and is to be receiued or taken by bodily inſtruments.

            <p>But if this be true,<note place="margin">Two abſurdities or errours.</note> we muſt learn to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the perſonal vnion, not by the effuſion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> or powring foorth of effectual graces, but of vertues rather.

            <p>And truly, if it were true, that chriſts body were in diuerſe reſpectes different from ours, then he could not be of the ſelfe ſame ſubſtaunce with vs, and like vnto vs in all things (ſinne onely excepted.<note place="margin">Hebr. 4.15.

When wee affirme, that a place can not be ſundered or taken from a body, that is, from that thing, which conſiſteth of three dimenſions or meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurings before mentioned (which thing the maintainers of conſubſtantiation do, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they flee to thoſe ſame ſtarting holes of his omnipotencie or almightie power,

This accident, though it be not the verie ſubſtance of the body, as in reſpect that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodie it ſelf is a ſubſtance, yet verilie as it is a quantity it formeth &amp; frameth the body, and it is an inſeparable accident of the body, aſwell as of the ſubſtance. So that there is no man (I ſuppoſe) but hee vnderſtandeth how vaine and ſophiſticall that exception is.

            <p>In the ſecond place, the deepe and due <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> conſideration of theſe three circumſtances folowing, will ſerue much for the cleering of this queſtion alſo, touching the Lords ſupper.</p>
            <p n="1">

            <p n="3">
               <hi>3</hi> Thirdlie the analogie, proportion and agreement, which is betweene the ſignes, and the things ſignified, the Lord no doubt chooſing ſuch elementes as might moſt aptlie and fitlie expreſſe the things ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and ſealed by the ſame: for otherwiſe, if we had had bare ſignes alone, without holie things ſignified in and by the ſame, as our faith had no whit at all beene pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for, becauſe it being ſpirituall and inward, is not, nor cannot be nouriſhed with outward and corporall thinges, ſo wee might eaſilie haue beene carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:9515:83"/> or ſaid, I would pray the godlie and well affected reader, diligently to obſerue and note theſe three things following.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1</hi> Firſt, that though it be moſt true, that euen by the miniſterie of the Goſpell preached, we haue Chriſt with all his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits offered vnto vs, and doo by faith wrought in our harts, by the miniſterie of the ſame word, and working of his ſpirit, take hold of him &amp; all his graces, of which alſo S.

               <hi>euen as the father and he are one:</hi> which I ſpeake not to the debaſing of the word, as though the ſacraments were more woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie and excellent, or to the diuiding of Chriſt, for as in reſpect of his ſubſtance, he is but one, both in the word and the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, but as in reſpect of vs, and for
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:9515:83"/> our weakeneſſe ſake, we hauing more of our ſences ſatiſfied in and by the vſe of the elements of the Lords ſupper, as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, our ſight, our taſt, our feeling, yea and our hearing alſo, whileſt that in the deliuerie and partaking thereof, Chriſtes death is preached vnto vs, than we haue in the word which is directed onelie to the eare or hearing.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2</hi> Secondlie, that this holie ſacrament dooth not onelie direct our faith to the death and paſſion of our ſauiour Chriſt, which was performed for vs and all the faithfull manie hundered yeeres agone, as <hi>the one,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hebr. 9.28. Hebr. 10.14.</note>

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:9515:84"/> in a ſtrong perſuaſion of Gods goodneſſe towards vs in Chriſt, be made partakers thereof. For otherwiſe, if we had but Chriſtes death onelie, and nothing elſe, it would be little auailable to vs: for what would it haue profited vs that he had died, <hi>if by his death he had not brought life and immortality to light?</hi>
               <note place="margin">2.

            <p n="3">
               <hi>3</hi> Thirdlie, that wee muſt certeinelie know, and ſtedfaſtlie beleeue that though this holie ſacrament doo ſpeciallie and cheeflie direct vs to Chriſt, his death, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, obedience, and the frutes thereof, yet notwithſtanding alſo, it doth ſenſiblie and plainelie inſtruct vs in the ſpeciall duties of that ſound and ſincere loue, which in Chriſt, and for Chriſt, we as the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that bodie, whereof <hi>he is the only head,</hi>

            <p>In the third place, for the cleering of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> this controuerſie or queſtion of the Lords ſupper, we muſt haue a watchfull eie to Satans ſubtleties, who painfully labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in this point, as in all other pointes of Chriſtian religion alſo, by extremities to drawe vs into all corruption. Nowe the extremities that in time heeretofore haue burſt foorth, and are yet euen to this day, in manie places, ſtoutlie and ſtiflie mainteined, are eſpeciallie three.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1</hi> The firſt is, that of the ſacramenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:9515:85"/> who hold and defend, that Chriſt in his ſupper hath left vs nothing ſaue the bare and naked ſignes of his death and paſſion. But the trueth is, that we are ſo farre off from allowing this conceit and opinion, whatſoeuer our aduerſaries bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and prate to the contrarie, that wee feare not openlie, and in the ſunne light to affirme, that beſides the ſignes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, yea and euen togither with the ſignes, wee and all true chriſtians haue the thinges themſelues ſignified, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie truelie and effectuallie exhibited vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, but giuen vs alſo, and beſtowed vpon vs, becauſe it is moſt certeine, that our Sauiour Chriſt,<note place="margin">Iohn. 14.6.</note>

Beſides, if men ſhould imbrace this ſacramentarie opinion, what were it but to euert, as the trueth of Chriſtes promiſes, ſo the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinetie and aſſuredneſſe of his word, who in plaine termes calleth this holie ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his bodie?

            <p n="2">
               <hi>2</hi> The ſecond extremitie is that of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation,

This propoſition is prooued by this marime in logike: If the definition of a thing, which cheeflie conſiſteth of the eſſentiall proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the thing, be taken away, then the thing it ſelfe alſo defined falleth away? as for example: If reaſonable liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is the definition of a man be taken away, what ſhall become of man? or where ſhall he appeare, which is the thing defined? whereof alſo there is good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe the eſſentiall propertie is it that conſtituteth or maketh the thing. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto the maior propoſition, as we ſay in ſchooles, with the proofs thereof. Now foloweth the minor or ſecond propoſition: But theſe men take away the eſſentiall propertie of a thing, to wit, of a bodie which is to be circumſcriptible or tied to
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:9515:87"/> a place, which is in deed an eſſentiall propertie of the bodie of man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of Chriſtes bodie as hee is man, whileſt they will haue him, as he is man, in ſundrie places at one time. If anie man will denie this, it may eaſilie be prooued both by their owne writinges in ſundrie places, and alſo by the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a bodie, which is a quantitie that may be diuided according to the threefold meaſuring receiued amongeſt men, that is, length, breadth, and thickeneſſe, and likewiſe by the deſcription of a place, which is defined to be a nighneſſe or tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the thing conteining and the thing conteined. The concluſion therfore is, that in taking away place from the bodie of Chriſt (which they doo, whileſt they place it in euerie place, whereas in the nature thereof, it can be but in one place at one time) they doo vtterlie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroie the bodie or humanitie of Chriſt, or at the leaſt confound it ſo with the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, as <hi>Eutyches</hi> did, that they make a confuſion (whereas in all trueth and vprightneſſe, there ſhoulde remaine a diſtinction of the proprieties of either nature in his bleſſed perſon. But of

               <hi>1</hi> Firſt, I ſaye, that this aſſertion of Tranſubſtantiation, or reall preſence of Chriſtes naturall bodie, dooth vtterlie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowe and deſtroy the nature of a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, which, as all men knowe and confeſſe, muſt euer conſiſt of two partes, to wit, of viſible elements, and inuiſible graces: the trueth whereof appeareth not onely by the generall conſent of all men, as before is alleadged, but alſo by the particular viewe of all the Sacramentes mentioned in the olde or newe teſtament. But this trueth is not onely defaced, and laid euen wyth the ground, but ſwalowed vp alſo, and, as it were, broght to nothing, if ſo be it, that the nature and ſubſtance of the elements, bee either chaunged, or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh awaie, in this matter of the lords ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as ſome affirme and hold, &amp; the things repreſented by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame come in their place. The reaſon wherof is plaine and euident,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:9515:92"/> to witte, that the one parte of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, namely, the viſible ſigne, is then and there abſent. And therefore it muſt of neceſſitie followe, that not onelie the nature of a Sacrament is deſtroyed, but by conſequent alſo the Sacrament it ſelf, becauſe the nature of a thing being taken away, the thing it ſelfe can not ſtand or continue, for the nature is it, whereof the thing it ſelfe conſiſteth. Yea this alſo falleth out vpon it, that thoſe men that in the pride and vanitie of their owne hearts inlarge the number of Sacraments, aboue them that chriſt hath left vnto his church, publiſhing to the worlde, that there are ſeauen, where indeede there are but two. In the true and naturall vſe of the worde Sacrament, are founde, not onelie to bee clippers of the Lordes coine, but vtter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facers of his holie ordinaunce, in taking from the Churche (whatſoeuer they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the contrarie) one of thoſe that Chriſt hath left to the ſame, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte thereof: beeing founde likewiſe by this meanes, not onelie preſumptuous againſt Chriſt, but iniurious alſo to the people, in ſpoiling them of ſo great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation.

In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede if the ſigne of the ſacrament, and the thing ſignified by the ſame, were thinges contrary, they might haue ſome ſhew of reaſon, for this vnmeaſurable affection, but foraſmuch as wee all knowe them to be, not things contrary, but diuers, no doubt, but they not onely may, but do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well ſtand together, the one of them beeing ſo farre, from deſtroying or defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of an other, that they in a moſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing conſent agree and concurre together to the ſetting foorth of Gods glorie, and the ſpirituall good and comforte of hys children.

And to ſaye that that one bleſſed bodie of his was diuided, is as abſurde and erronious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it can not be ſo, but that the whole bodie it ſelfe muſt be impaired and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, at the leaſt, if not deſtroyed and ſo

Reaſon will lead vs to this, that none can be ſaid to goe vp into the place where he is, or to come

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:9515:104"/> for, for that were, at the leaſt, great vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſſe, both towards the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and men alſo, neither yet failing in the allegation of them, either in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, maner, or ende, for if wee do ſo, we doo nothing elſe therby, but heape vp iuſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation againſt our owne ſoules, but reuerently receiuing them, and faithfully alleadging them in that iuſte meaſure, weight, and proportion, that the Lorde himſelfe hath left them vnto vs, euen as his onlie lawful and currant coine, which we can not clip, imbaſe, or impaire anie manner of waye, without high treaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his eternall maieſtie. Nowe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the wordes, and the plaineneſſe of them, I ſay, that other wordes, both in the old and new Teſtament, are as plaine as they, which yet notwithſtanding muſt be otherwiſe interpreted, than the woords themſelues ſeeme to import, or elſe, not onelye abſurdities in reaſon, but errors in religion will inſue therevpon. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in the booke of Exodus, the paſchal lambe, with the ceremonies belonging thereto, is called, <hi>The Lords paſſeouer:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 12.11.</note> whereas nowe we knowe, and no manne can chooſe but confeſſe, that it was not
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:9515:105"/> the Lordes paſſeouer in deede, but ſig<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nified and ſette out the ſame rather. For the Lordes paſſeouer was his ouer-paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing or paſſing by the Iſraelites houſes, marked wyth the bloud of the Lambe, to the Egyptians, there to deſtroy the firſt borne. So likewiſe in the newe Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">Iohn 15.5.</note> Chriſt ſayth of hym ſelfe, <hi>I am the vine,</hi> than the which what can bee more plaine? And yet wee acknowledge wyth our mouthes, and beleeue in our heartes, that Chriſt was no naturall vine, but rather that hee calleth himſelfe ſo, in a certaine reſemblaunce, becauſe looke what propertie the fruit of the vine hath in reſpect of our bodies, to witte, to comforte menne, and to make them glad heartes, the ſame hath Chriſt and the fruites of his grace receiued by Fayth, in reſpect of our ſoules, namelie, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhe our heartes wyth all Spirituall ioye and gladneſſe, both of this life, and of the life to come. And as the braunches of the vine, haue nothing of themſelues, but all that they haue, they haue it from the vine it ſelfe, ſo none whoſoeuer they be can bring foorth fruit, but by abiding in him, and beeing made fruitefull tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:9515:105"/> hys grace. And euen in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is the bread of the Lordes Supper called hys bodie, becauſe (as wee haue ſaide before) looke what proper and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar office, the bread hath or yeeldeth to our naturall bodies, namely, to nouriſh and ſtrengthen the ſame, the like dooth Ieſus Chriſtes bodie broken, taken hold of by Faith, Spirituallie communicate vnto our ſoules, namelie, it feedeth and ſtrengtheneth them, to the aſſured hope and feeling of eternall life. And this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpeech, attributing that to the ſigne which is proper and peculiar to the thing ſignified, is very vſuall in the Scripture, as a man meanely conuerſant in the ſame may plainelie perceiue: the cauſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is, the ſtraight analogy, proportion, &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, which is between y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſigne, &amp; the thing ſignified, and not anie other reſpect of conſubſtantiation, tranſubſtantiation, or any ſuch like fantaſticall dotage. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all theſe thinges, the very circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunces of time, place, perſon, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of dooing, doo ſufficientlie ſette out the vanitie and vntrueth of this groſſe interpretation. For this Sacrament beeing inſtituted by Chriſt him ſelfe a

               </gap> with them, and not onely in their hearing ſpeaking theſe woordes, but alſo in their ſight and preſence actuallie breaking the bread, it coulde not be that that bread offered vnto them, as the pledge of his bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>die, ſhoulde be his naturall bodie or bodie of fleſh: vnleſſe you will ſaye, that Chriſt had two bodies, one ſitting at the Table, inſtituting the action of the Supper, and adminiſtring the ſame in his own perſon, and an other borne in his handes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered vnto the Apoſtles, than the which what can be, not onely more abſurde and blaſphemous, in reſpect of our Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe, he being by this means made a monſter, and not become man, but alſo more vnprofitable or vncertain to vs, as which might iuſtly prouoke vs to dout whether of his bodies were crucified for our tranſgreſſions? And thus as wee doo, for good cauſes before ſpecified, as you ſee reiect this groſe ſenſe, ſo for the inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:9515:106"/> of the ignoraunt, and ſtrengthening of the weake, we wil in a fewe lines putte downe the true meaning of theſe wordes. For the better performaunce whereof I woulde haue this to bee noted in the firſt place, which I am ſure alſo no man of ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d iudgement can well deny, that all woords and ſayings whatſoeuer, muſt be expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, according to the ſubiect, argument, or matter whereof they intreat: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe woordes alſo, ſpeaking particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of the Lordes ſupper, muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie be vnderſtoode of the Sacrament of the bodie and bloud of our Sauior Chriſt, exhibited vnto vs in that ſupper. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe wee muſt ſaye, that Chriſt ſpake of one thing, and meant an other, which as it might be iniurious to our ſelues, wee not knowing which way to take Chriſtes wordes, ſo ſhoulde it accuſe him for want of plaine dealing, which dotage differeth not muche from blaſphemie againſt his perſon. Secondlie, I would haue this to be remembred, that ſeeing all, one and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, both we, and our aduerſaries, confes theſe woordes to be ſpoken of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wee muſt not gather that the word bodie is otherwiſe attributed to the bread
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:9515:107"/> than the nature and qualitie (as a manne would ſay) of ſacraments wil beare: for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if we ſhould grant that, wee might eaſilie deſtroy and ouerthrow al the ſacraments, that either haue bene or are in the Church of God, becauſe in this behalfe or reſpect there is a like proportion to bee obſerued in one, as in al, and if one be defaced in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of a wrong ſenſe, the reſt can hardly or not at all ſtande vpright. For ſith the ſcripture ſpeaking of Sacraments, vſeth one ordinarie and common kinde of ſpeach to them all, what reaſon can there be ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, that the words in one ſacrament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnderſtoode ſo, the ſelfe-ſame wordes ſhoulde not haue the ſelfe-ſame ſenſe and meaning in other? Thirdly, that this is the nature of all ſacraments, that the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and rites vſed in the ſame, be true and effectuall, not ſignes onelie, but teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and pledges alſo of thoſe thinges, for the ſignifieng and ſubiecting of which vnto our ſenſes, they were ordayned, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the nature of a ſacrament ſhould be ouerthrowen, which conſiſteth of an outwarde and viſible element, and of an inward and inuiſible grace, and wee ſpoiled of our faith, which is not, ne ought
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:9515:107"/> not to bee occupied about thoſe groſſe and earthlie matters, but vpon ſpirituall and heauenly things only. And yet when I vſe this word (ſigne) I woulde not bee taken as though I meant, that they are bare, vaine, or vnprofitable ſignes, ſuch as pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters commonly vſe to make, but euen thus far forth effectuall, that it is no more true &amp; certaine, that we ſee the ſame wyth our eies, touch them wyth our handes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceue them with our mouths and eat them, than that it is alſo as true &amp; certaine, that the Lord exhibiteth and offereth vnto vs, yea, and giueth vs alſo, whatſoeuer they repreſent vnto vs, that is, the very bodie and bloud of our ſauior Chriſt &amp; the fruits &amp; effects flowing from the ſame, to be the ſpiritual food of our ſoules, to the full poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of eternall life. Theſe rules being thus then obſerued, I gather &amp; put downe this true and holie ſenſe of theſe wordes: This is my bodie, that is to ſay, that the bread which Chriſt tooke, bleſſed, brake, and gaue vnto his diſciples, appointing the ſame to bee vſed, as the element of this action, and to bee continued in hys Church, in ſuch forme and ſort as he did inſtitute it, vntill his comming againe,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:9515:108"/> is ſacramentally and ſpiritually, beeing receiued and eaten by faith, a ſure ſigne, and an effectuall pledge, that Chriſts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is become the ſpirituall foode of our ſoules. And I vſe theſe woordes, ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally and ſpiritually, that thereby I might meete with their groſſe ſlaunder, who, when they heare of a ſign, and a thing ſignified, ſaye, that wee doo euacuate and make of no force the Lordes ſupper. No, wee are ſo farre off from holding any ſuch concluſion, that wee knowe, beleeue, and confeſſe, that the faithfull and duelie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared communicants, doo beſides the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſignes and elements truelye receiue by the meane of faith, after a ſpirituall ſort, that which is repreſented by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward elements, to wit, whole Chriſt, with all his giftes and graces. And yet for the dooing of this, we do not pull Chriſtes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die out of heauen, or elſe imagine either Tranſubſtantiation, or any ſuch like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe, but onely thinke vpon and beleeue, the ſacramentall coniunction of the ſigne, and the thing ſignified, for thoſe thinges can not ſtand with the trueth of Chriſtes manhoode, as hath beene before ſhewed, neither indeede are they neceſſarie to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:9515:108"/> becauſe that to the ende, we may be made partakers of chriſt, it is not of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie required, that his bodie ſhoulde be really preſent vppon earth, but it rather behooueth vs, by the power of the Holie ghoſt, and thorowe faith, to mount vppe into heauen, and there to lay hold of him, that wee may ſit with him in the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie places, which in this life can not bee perfourmed in anye other ſorte, than in a ſpirituall maner, and thorow faith, which faith is begotten and confirmed in vs by the holie-ghoſt, wherevnto hee vſeth as inſtrumentes, the preachyng of Gods worde, and the adminiſtration and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the Sacraments, by which all our ſenſes, are euen as it were, prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and preſſed, wholie to poſſeſſe Chriſt himſelfe.

               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:9515:109"/> of in our corruption, we hardly conceiuing it now in our regeneration &amp; newe birth, ſo coulde it not haue bin performed in the godhead alone. Not that I meane, that GOD was not able to haue forgiuen the ſinnes of his people, and to haue releaſed them from condemnation, and reſtored them to euerlaſting life, but that GOD could not by ſuffering, becauſe his eſſence and nature, is altogither impaſſible, haue ſuffered anye thing for our redemption. Wherefore, for as much as, the queſtion betweene the Tranſubſtantiators and vs, is not nowe, of the preſence of Chriſtes deitie in the Sacrament, but of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his humane body, we ſay, and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirme it alſo, that if we ſhoulde grant this, yet could it no whit at all preiudice vs, neither coulde they gaine their cauſe thereby, for vnleſſe they can proue Chriſt, as he is man, to be omnipotent, and euery where (which thing they ſhall neuer bee able to doo) they haue ſaide as much, as if they had ſaide nothing at all. But let vs for reaſoning ſake graunt them this muche, that Chriſt as hee is man, were omnipotent, euen as GOD the Father, or hee himſelfe in reſpect of his Godhead
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:9515:109"/> is: Dooth it therefore followe, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee can doo euerie thing, hee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore either will doo the ſame, or indeede dooth it? I ſuppoſe verilye, no. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, in Schooles it is commonlie ſaide, <hi>a poſſe ad eſſe,</hi> the conſequence or reaſon is not good, which were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent aunſweare to this friuolous and vaine obiection, mannes reaſon in the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and corruption of it, beeing endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wyth ſtrength and force enough to aunſweare the ſame: beſides this, I ſay, wee that are truelie taught of GOD, both by his worde and ſpirite, do knowe, that though wee beleeue, that the Lorde can doo whatſoeuer pleaſeth him both in heauen and in earth, which ſerueth won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully to magnifie hys almightie pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the exceeding excellencie thereof, and greatlie to ſtrengthen our weake faith, in the dayes of our calamities and diſtreſſes, yet notwythſtanding we firmelie beleeue, that hee will not onelie doo nothing, but that hee can not doo anie thing in regarde of vs, contrarie vnto that will of his, that hee hath reuealed for vs in his word. For euen as a manne of might on earth, hauing giuen foorth hys ſpeache of aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:9515:110"/> in the woorde of a Prince or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, though perhappes to one farre infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to himſelfe, is yet notwythſtanding tied thereby, not as in reſpect of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, for that remaineth as greate after as before, but as in regarde of his credite, and the perſons to whome hee hath by his woorde after a ſorte, as it were bounde himſelfe: ſo is it wyth the Lord to vs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. And the reaſon of this is, not the abridgement or ſhortening of his power, (for be it farre from mortall men, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume in any thing, though neuer ſo litle, to reſtrain the eternal power of the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall God) but becauſe his will and power (I meane of the ſame, as they are reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to vs by his woorde, and particularlie by his promiſes made vnto vs therin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſame) be in reſpect of vs, ſo conioyned and knit together, that looke whatſoeuer hee will doo, that hee can doo, and looke whatſoeuer he can do, that hee will doo. Oh howe vnreaſonable is this, that wee will giue earthlie Potentates leaue, becauſe of their high callings and excellent wiſedome, that wee ſuppoſe to bee in them nowe and then, to hedge in the boundes of their power and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:9515:110"/> by their woordes at their owne plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and will not graunt or yeelde ſo muche to the Almightie? Surelie there is very great and good reaſon to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, for as for menne, by reaſon of the blindeneſſe and ignorauncie of their owne heartes they can not well tell when it is good, either to ſtraiten or enlarge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, whereas GOD, by reaſon of the fulneſſe of goodneſſe that is in him can not chooſe but doo good, whether he inlarge or abridge himſelfe. But to make all this plaine, by one or two examples in ſteade of manie, we are all perſwaded, that God can not drowne the worlde anie more, wyth the waters of an vniuerſall floud, becauſe wee knowe by his woorde he will not, for the more certaine and aſſured ſealing vppe of the ſame in our heartes, and not for anie diſcredite vnto hym, or ſhortening of hys arme and power, hee hath not onelie geuen vs his comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſweete woorde of promiſe, but hath <hi>ſette his bowe in the cloudes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 9.12, 13, &amp;c</note> to bee a moſte effectuall pledge of the ſame vnto vs. Agayne, wee all doo knowe and beleeue, that though GOD, in reſpect both of hymſelfe, and his almighty
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:9515:111"/> power, with whome all thinges, yea, the moſt hardeſt, are poſſible, can if he would ſaue all men, yet we feare not to ſaye and affirme, that in reſpect of vs hee can not ſaue all menne, becauſe wee knowe by his reuealed will in his woorde, that hee will not ſaue them all. For ſome, as well for the manifeſtation of hys iuſtice and iudgement againſt all vngodlineſſe, muſt bee the veſſelles ordayned for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, as well as others alſo for the declaration of his mercie, in ſauing whom hee will, veſſelles of ſaluation and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life. And euen the like maie we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, touching this matter of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, namelie, that though wee were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded or ſhoulde graunt, agaynſt all trueth and reaſon, that Chriſt, as hee is GOD might doo what hee woulde, or as hee is man, might bee euery where, yet becauſe hee hath reuealed the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye in his woorde, and namelie, that hee will haue hys bodye to bee circumſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and tied to a place, to wit, Heauen, yea, which is more, to a certaine place in heauen (for though Chriſt as in reſpect of hys eternall Godhead, fill Heauen and earth, and the heuen of heuens is not able
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:9515:111"/> to conteine him, yet in reſpect of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane bodie, though it be glorified, he is &amp; muſt be conteined in ſome part of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens) that therefore it can be no iniury at all to him, neither any debaſing of his om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent power, to ſay that now he cannot be bodilie in the ſacrament, much leſſe bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilie in ſo manie ſacraments, as be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated and miniſtred in ſo ſundrie and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit places at one time, no more than it is to God the father, in ſaieng that now he cannot drowne the world, or ſaue the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probat, as hath beene before declared.</p>

But ſuppoſe it were Chriſtes body, as they ſay it is, yet I affirme, that they may not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ore Chriſtes bodie alone, yea and that they cannot worſhip the ſame of it ſelfe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out horrible idolatrie, wherof alſo the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is plaine and euident, namelie becauſe it is a creature, to which it is not lawfull to giue that honor that is due vnto the creator alone, becauſe he being ielous o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his owne glory, will not haue it giuen to anie other. For though it be true, that Chriſt as he is god, is to be worſhipped as his father: yea &amp; Chriſt God &amp; man in one perſon is to be adored, yet we cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great ſin, and greeuous offenſe againſt God &amp; his word, worſhip the humanity or manhood of our ſauior Chriſt onlie.

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:9515:115"/> I anſwer, that beſides, it is a fallacie or deceit in reaſoning, called in ſchooles <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacia diuiſionis,</hi> it is a flat contrarie to the truth of chriſtian religion, which teacheth vs, that many things may be ſpoken of the perſon of our ſauior Chriſt, which can not rightlie or truelie be ſaid of either nature, and the reaſon is, becauſe as the vnitie of the perſon muſt be maineteined &amp; vpheld, ſo muſt godlie men haue an eſpeciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, that they confound not the ſeuerall proprieties of either nature. To make this plaine by a point or two. A man may ſaflie ſay, that Chriſt God and man in one perſon was crucified on the croſſe, &amp; died for our ſinnes, whereof alſo this is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie true and ſufficient reaſon, becauſe in his whole perſon he performed the worke of our redemption, and not in either of the natures alone, or by it ſelfe: but nowe if heerevpon a man ſhould ſay and conclude, therfore Chriſt God was crucified for our ſinnes, beſides that he ſhould vtter an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour or hereſie in chriſtian religion, hee ſhould ſpeake blaſphemie againſt God, whoſe nature (as we haue ſaid heertofore) is altogither impoſſible. Likewiſe a man may ſaflie ſay and affirme, that the virgin
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:9515:115"/> Marie was the mother of our Sauiour Chriſt, as hee is God and man in one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: the reaſon is, becauſe that euen from the verie moment of his bleſſed concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the wombe of the virgine, the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head and the manhood,<note place="margin">Romans. 9.5.</note> were inſeperablie ioyned and knit togeather in that one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>Ieſus Chriſt, who is God ouer all, to be bleſſed for euer and euer.</hi> But if here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon a man would inferre, therefore ſhe is or may bee called the mother of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that hee ſhoulde ſpeake againſt the groundes and principles of ſounde faith, which teacheth vs, that as chriſt in reſpect of his manhood was without father, ſo in reſpect of his godhead he was without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he ſhold ſpeak very proudly of fleſh &amp; bloud, and very baſely of God, as though that the creature, were in time before the creator, or God could not bee without the helpe of pore and weake women.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, becauſe there is no good thing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſo wel done, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pleaſure or profit in time afterward, may therby redound to the doer yea becauſe ther is nothing ſo wel done by men, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by reaſon of the imperfection of mans nature, ſom thing muſt ſtil be added,

            <p>AT the motion and request of ſundrie my deere friends in the Lord, I haue thought good to put downe theſe two praiers following, not thereby minding, either to tie anie perſon to the vſe of theſe onelie (for they may accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their ſeuerall neceſſities, conceiue ſome other of their owne, or practiſe ſome bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter forme alredie ſet foorth, by men of greater gifts or feeling) nor yet ſo to buſie their minds, and to occupie their heads, as that they ſhould be imploied in theſe, when the publike praiers and exerciſes of the church, performed by the miniſters, are in hand (for be it farre from vs, when the miniſter (Gods mouth) ſpeaketh from the Lord to vs, or when he as our mouth, ſpeaketh to the Lord for vs, to haue either our hearts or our mouthes occupied about any other thing, than the reuerend hearing and conſenting vnto, of ſuch things as hee vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.)

            <p>O Eternall God, and moſt mercifull father, I thy poore and vnwoorthie ſeruant doo humblie beſeech thee in Ieſus Chriſt thy deere ſons name, and for his ſake, gratiouſlie through his death and obedience, to pardon and forgiue me all my ſinnes whatſoeuer, which at anie time, by thought, word, or deed, I haue, through negligence, ignorance, or knowledge, committed againſt thy diuine maieſtie, or anie other. And becauſe both by reaſon of the curſſed corruption of mine owne nature, and the infinit multitude of my ſinnes alſo, I am ſlow &amp; dull of heart to beleeue, ſeale vp in my ſoule I pray thee O Lord, this great benefit of the free pardon &amp; full forgiueneſſe of all my ſinnes, by the aſſured teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of thy bleſſed ſpirit, bearing record vnto my ſpirit that I am thy childe, and by vnfeined parddo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and forgiuing of others, which anie maner of way haue offended againſt me. Yea make the death and reſurrection of thy ſonne ſo powerfull &amp; effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall in me, that I may not onelie feele and finde in the ſame, the forgiueneſſe of all my ſinnes, both ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and particular, and the hope of eternall ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, but alſo that I may be inſtructed thereby, all the daies of my life, more and more to die vnto ſin, and dailie more &amp; more to liue vnto righteouſnes of life and holie conuerſation. And foraſmuch as through thy goodneſſe, I haue purpoſed this day to communicat, in the vſe of thy bleſſed word and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, I beſeech thee (good father) to pearſe mine eares, to prepare my heart, yea and ſo to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect all the parts and powers of my body and ſoule, that I may not onelie reuerentlie and profitablie
<pb facs="tcp:9515:129"/> hearken to thy voice, ſpeaking vnto me out of thy word, laboring all the daies of my life to conforme my ſelfe to the knowledge, faith, and obedience of the ſame, but alſo that I may aſſuredlie be made partaker of the frutes and effects of the death and paſſion of thy deere ſonne, which it pleaſeth thee in that holie ſacrament, to offer vnto me. To this end and purpoſe I beſeech thee to grant, that I be not carried away in the contemplation and conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the earthly and corruptible things, obiected therein to my ſences, but that my faith may be ſet vp &amp; raiſed to the ſpirituall beholding, aſſured fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and full fruition of theſe graces, which it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth thee by the ſame to offer vnto me. Giue me grace (good Lord) to bring with me a ſtedfaſt faith in the truth of thy promiſes, that by it, as by an eie, I may looke vpon, and by the ſame, as by a hand, I may apprehend Ieſus Chriſt thy ſonne, ſitting at thy right hand, to be my onelie and continuall iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier, ſanctifier and redeemer.
